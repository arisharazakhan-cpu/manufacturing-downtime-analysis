Project goal: analyze manufacturing style sensor and operational data to understand drivers of downtime and build a model that estimates downtime risk.

Data: predictive maintenance style dataset with machine operating conditions, sensor measurements, and a downtime or failure label.

Outcome: an end to end analysis with clean visuals, a baseline predictive model, and actionable recommendations.
